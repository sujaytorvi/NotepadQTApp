# NotepadQTApp
Sample Notepad App made in QT Creator with few functions such as Bold. Italic, Underline, Subscript &amp; Superscript 

### 1. How to Run the code: 
=> Clone/Download the repository. The main branch has two folders Notepad_QT_App and Debug along with license and readme.md files

=> Go to Notepad_QT_App and open the Notepad_QT_App.pro file. This will open the project in QT Creator 

=> There you can view the code 

=> To run the app you can build the project and press control + R to run the app. 

 **Alternatively you can open the debug folder and run the Notepad_QT_App.exe present there**
 
 **This exe file is compliled using windeployqt.exe and hence will not throw any error** 
 
### 2. What has been done:
=> The notepad required to have 4 features namely Bold, Subscript & Superscript feature along with resume opening on a dialog box when about me menu is clicked

=> I have implemented additional 2 features: Italic and Underline 

**The code is tested for 70% of edge cases and functions should work fine for most of the times**

**However there may be small amount of cases where the functionality may not work as intended**

### 3. Issues/Challenges Faced: 

=> I'm a visual studio code user, hence required some time to learn QT Creator, it's widgets and functions and refresh c++ concepts (I'm an intermediate c++ user but it has been a long while since I touched c++ and made projects using it). Used youtube and QT Forum to solve problems whenever I got stuck

=> While making functionality I saw there were a few edge cases where the functionality could break and solved the obvious ones, however there may be some hidden edge cases and bugs where functionality may not always work.
*Perform Continuous Testing and Continuous Improvement to unveil new edge cases and bugs and continuously fix them*

### 4. Features Implemented:

#### i.   Bold Function: Makes selected text bold and also new characters that are entered. 
#### ii.  Italic Function: Makes selected text *Italic* and also new characters that are entered. 
#### iii. Underline Function: Makes selected text underline and also new characters that are entered. 
#### iv.  Subscript Function: Makes selected text subscripted and also new characters that are entered. 
#### v.   Superscript Function: Makes selected text superscripted and also new characters that are entered. 
#### vi.  Shows Resume when About me is clicked 

## At the time of creating this git repo the code is being tested and new fixes are pushed to the repo
