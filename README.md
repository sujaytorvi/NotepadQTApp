# NotepadQTApp
Sample Notepad App made in QT Creator with few functions such as Bold. Italic, Underline, Subscript &amp; Superscript 

### 1. How to Run the code: 
=> Clone/Download the repository. The main branch has two folders Notepad_QT_App and Debug along with license and readme.md files

=> Go to Notepad_QT_App and open the Notepad_QT_App.pro file. This will open the project in QT Creator 

=> There you can view the code 

=> To run the app you can build the project and press control + R to run the app. 

 **Alternatively you can open the debug folder and run the Notepad_QT_App.exe present there**
 
 **This exe file is compliled using windeployqt.exe and hence will not throw any error** 
 
### 2. What has been done:
=> The notepad required to have 4 features namely Bold, Subscript & Superscript feature along with resume opening on a dialog box when about me menu is clicked

=> I have implemented additional 2 features: Italic and Underline 

**The code is tested for 70% of edge cases and functions should work fine for most of the times**

**However there may be small amount of cases where the functionality may not work as intended**
